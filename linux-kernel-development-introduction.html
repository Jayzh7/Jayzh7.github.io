<hr>
<h3>OS components</h3>
<p>OS is considered the parts of the system responsible for basic use and administration which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>kernel and device drivers</li>
<li>bootloader</li>
<li>command shell</li>
<li>other user interface</li>
<li>basic file and system utilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically stuff that a user will need with UI as the outermost part and kernel as the innermost part.</p>
<p>Typical components of a kernel are:</p>
<ul>
<li>interrupt handler to service interrupt requests</li>
<li>a scheduler to share processor time among processes</li>
<li>a memory management system to manage process address spaces</li>
<li>system services like networking and IPC</li>
</ul>
<h3>User application and kernel communication</h3>
<p><strong>Kernel space</strong>: a protected memory space with full access to hardware where kernel resides.<br>
<strong>User space</strong>: where applications can only see a subset of machine's available resources and can perform certain system functions, directly access hardware, access memory outside of that allotted them by the kernel.</p>
<p>Applications running on the system communicates with the kernel via <em>system calls</em>. This is the fundamental manner in which applications get work done.</p>
<p>An application typically calls functions in a library (like <em>C library</em>) that in turn rely on systems calls to instruct the kernel to do tasks</p>
<p>Kernel also manages the system's hardware by supporting <em>interrupts</em>. However, it can disable interrupts (either all or some) for synchronization. The interrupt handlers do not run in a process context but in a special <em>interrupt context</em> which allows or intends to let it respond and exit quickly.</p>
<p>In Linux, we can generalize that each processor is doing exactly one of the three things at any given momentï¼š</p>
<ul>
<li>Executing user code in a process in user-space</li>
<li>Executing on behalf of a specfic process in kernel-space, in process context</li>
<li>Handling an interrupt in kernel-space, in interrupt context<br>

</ul>
<h2>2 Linux Versus Classic Unix Kernels</h2>
<hr>
<p>Common ancestry and same API, modern Unix kernels share various design traits. A Unix kernel is typically a monolithic (means single and large) static binary that runs in a single address space. Unix systems usually have a paged memory-management unit (MMU). Most Linux kernels also have it while some small embedded systems can also run without one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monotlithic kernel Versus Microkernel<br>
Monolithic kernel: entirely as a single process running in a single address space. Thus, such kernels existon disk as single static binaries.<br>
Microkernel: functionality of the kernel is broken down into separate processes. Only servers <em>absolutely</em> requiring such capabilities run in a privileged execution mode. Others run in user-space. All are separated into different address spaces in which direct function invocation is not possible. They communicate and invoke 'services' via an IPC - message passing. High fault tolerance due to the existance of multiple servers.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Linux is a monilithic kernel while it borrows a lot from microkernel design:</p>
<ul>
<li>modular design</li>
<li>kernel preemption</li>
<li>kernel threads</li>
<li>capability to dynamically load separate binaries (kernel modules) into kernel image.  </li>
</ul>
<p>It has no performance-sapping features of microkernel designs. Everything runs in kernel mode with direct function invocation.  </p>
<p>Notable difference between Linux kernel and classic Unix kernel:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Linux kernel is preemptive even for tasks executing in the kernel.</li>
<li>Linux does not differentiate between threads and normal processes. All processes are same while some (threads) happen to share resources. </li>
<li>Linux provides object-oriented device model with device classes, hot-pluggable events, a user-space device filesystem(sysfs).</li>
</ul>
<h2>3 Linux version</h2>
<hr>
<p>3 digits: major release, minor release, revision<br>
4 digits: 3 digits + stable version</p>
<p>An even minor release indicates a stable version.</p>
