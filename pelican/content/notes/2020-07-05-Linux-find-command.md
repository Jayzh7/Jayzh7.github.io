Apart from removing or copying files directly using regular expression, `find` offers more functionalities when searching for files.

# Command Options

|option| function |
|----|----|
|`-name` and `-iname` | find by name (ignore case) |
|`-mindepth` and `-maxdepth` | limit the search depth of directories |
|`-exec` | execute commands on the files found |
|`-not` | invert the match |
|`-inum` | find by inode number |
|`-perm` | specify file permissions, like `g=r`, or `755`|
|`-empty` | find empty files |
|`-type` | specify file `f`, directory `d`, socket files `s`,  |
|`-size` | find file by size `-100M`, less than 100M, `+100M`, more than 100M |
|`-mmin -n` | find files that are modified within `n` minutes | 
|`-mtime -n` | find files that are modified within `n` days (24 hour) |
|`-amin`, `-atime` | similiar to above (note that `+`, `-`, and no sign represents more than, within, and exactly)|
|

> File change time gets updated when the inode of the file changes
